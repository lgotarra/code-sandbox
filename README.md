# code-sandbox

This repository serves as a sandbox for practicing full-stack development concepts, with a focus on React, Next.js, Node.js, NestJS, TypeScript, and clean architecture principles.

The goal of this space is to explore technical challenges in a structured way, improve code quality, and prepare for time-constrained coding environments like technical interviews or assessments.

Each section is organized by category (frontend, backend, hooks, algorithms), and individual exercises live in their own folders with detailed instructions, setup steps, and expected results.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

This sandbox focuses primarily on:

- React + Next.js
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit & React Hooks
- Express.js & NestJS
- Node.js
- Clean Code & Hexagonal Architecture principles

## 📂 Folder overview

- **frontend/** – Interface-based challenges using React/Next.js, Redux, and Hooks
- **backend/** – API-building tasks using Express and NestJS
- **hooks/** – Exercises focused on mastering built-in React Hooks
- **algorithms/** – Data manipulation and optimization problems (filter, map, reduce, etc.)
- **shared/** – Optional space for reusable utilities or configurations

## 🚧 Work in progress

This repository is actively evolving. Each subfolder includes its own README with context, input/output examples, and tech-specific focus.
